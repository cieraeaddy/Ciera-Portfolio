      <p>I have been in Girl Scout for about 11 years now and love who it's really help me to become. Girl Scout allows people to be honest and true to themseleves and it helps us figure out what turly makes us happy. I say this because over the year I realize that I love to help and take care for people and to be around the people who genuinely make me happy. I also would never have found the amazing group of friends that I have now, and I owe it all to Girl Scouts.  </p>

      <p>One time my troop and I lead a day of play at a camp called camp Kitty. The girls had a blast and so did we but there was one girl in particular that we just couldn't forget. Her name was Isha and we became instant friends. Sometimes when I go to camp I will see her and we will are alway next to each other. I am just glad that I could make a difference in her life.</p>
